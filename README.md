# Multivariate-Adaptive-Regression-Splines-MARS-
The MarsProject package facilitates regression modeling with multiple input variables using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) algorithm. Through functions like mars(), Fwd_stepwise, and Bwd_stepwise, it enables the creation of piecewise linear basis functions to capture complex nonlinear relationships between predictors and responses. With tools like mars.control() and validate_mars.control(), users can configure and validate control parameters, while helper functions streamline tasks like basis matrix setup and variable selection. This comprehensive toolkit ensures adaptable and reliable regression modeling for various applications.
